   I benefited from github, and I want to contribute my project.

   I want to design a smart home, which can know you well.Now I have two modules. 
one is for android phone, anther is for android TV. they know each other by DLNA.

   My plan is every module in the room attach to android TV module,and we can control the devices by phone. 
and every module also have self-control ability

   I have found some  suppliers to offer development board

   Welcome use this project in your product and DIY your smart home.Sorry for my poor English~
